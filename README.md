# ComponentOne ASP.NET MVC Edition Samples

Deliver highly interactive web and mobile applications with essential UI controls for ASP.NET Core MVC.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne ASP.NET MVC Edition](https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/aspnet-core-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the ASP.NET Core control features. They are also included with the full download and install from grapecity.com/componentone. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample

* .NET Framework samples require VS2012 and above.
* .NET Core samples will require VS2019 and above.

You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the .NET Core SDK. Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:
```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```
This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
