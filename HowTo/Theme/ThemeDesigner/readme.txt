ASP.NET MVC Theme Designer
------------------------------------------
Helps you to create custom ComponentOne MVC themes.

Use the color pickers to build a theme, then copy the CSS into your project 
as a new custom theme.

Make sure to add this CSS after ComponentOne MVC styles to ensure it 
overrides the default theme. We recommend placing this CSS in a separate file.
