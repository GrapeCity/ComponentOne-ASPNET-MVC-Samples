ASP.NET MVC Calendar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C1 MVC version of the Slack status page: https://status.slack.com/calendar

This sample uses:

1) Some CSS to give the calendar a specific appearance.

2) The Calendar's formatItem event to indicate days where events took place.

3) A single Tooltip to display additional information about each day.
